# 02 Personal Project Portfolio

## Description

I created a webpage using HTML and CSS.  This will be my personal portfolio for projects created during this coding bootcamp.  The goal of this page is to be a resource for my career growth moving forward.  When applying for jobs in the future, I plan to utilize this webpage so that recruiters and hiring managers can see samples of my work and the types of projects I can/will be able to complete.
